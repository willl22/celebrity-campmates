# celebrity-campmates
### The Scenario:
You're stuck on a deserted island and, for some reason, so are a bunch of celebrities. In their infinite wisdom, they have appointed you as their leader.
It's your job to assign jobs to them. You could think about it carefully and give each person the job that suits them best to give you the best chance of survival...
OR you can do it at random and hope it all works out.

This script will perform the latter. 

### The code:
There are 9 jobs and 10 celebrities to choose from. The jobs are grouped into three sets of three.

The script selects one of the first three jobs at random and one random celebrity, then one of the second three jobs and a celebrity, then one of the third three jobs and a celebrity. 
It then outputs a message to say jobs a, b, c are assigned to celebrities x, y, z (although the same celebrity can be chosen for multiple jobs).

It will then calculate a random percentage and output that as your chance of survival. The script will also output a message of encouragement/condolence based on your chance of survival.

### The output:
When you run the script locally in Node, it will look something like this:

#### How to use:
The script is a .js file which can be downloaded and opened in a text-editor. To run the script, use the command line to navigate to the directory where you've saved the file. Then type 
`node CelebCampMates.js` and hit enter.
